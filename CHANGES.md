v0.1.2-draft
  - Created new sections in BP and BDF: "Rules only defining INVALIDS". Moved the *No time only rule* and *Deleting century rule* into those respective sections.
  - To "Rules only defining INVALIDS" added *No ordinal date rule* and *No ordinal week rule*.
  - Adjusted "Example comparison" and "Quick Reference" to accommodate the above.

  - Turned editor's note into
    > Conformance can be claimed for the Bibliographic ISO 8601 Profile alone. That is, by ignoring the Bibliographic Standard-Transformation. In that case the "quick reference" will be, in effect, the left hand column of BP Versus BDF: VALID examples.
  - To key added
    >  A rule may have one or more clauses (that comprise the rule text).    

  - Added BibliographicDateFormat-ChangesSinceLastVersion.pdf
